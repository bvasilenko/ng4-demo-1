# Knaqq Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Package installation

Before running other commands, please run

`npm install`

## Running

Please use the following `npm` commands to run a one-line build:

`npm start` compiles TypeScript, puts the results in-memory (not anything saving to disk), and launches web development server to serve these files. TypeScript files are compiled without AoT, leaving variable and class names intact. Recommended for developers to see results immediately while working with HTML/CSS, and debugging the TypeScript logic.

`npm run build` generates an application package inside `dist` dir. TypeScript files are compiled with ahead-of-time (AoT) compilation. This is for production. Everything is packaged and minified for performance and minimum bundle size. Variable and class names are obfuscated, so this mode is not suitable for debugging.
